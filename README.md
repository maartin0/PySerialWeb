# PySerialWeb
A [Web Serial API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Serial_API) wrapper for [Pyodide](https://github.com/pyodide/pyodide) (wip)

Currently, this is a very limited implementation with just support for reading and writing with `Python 3.11`/`Pyodide 0.25.1`. The control signals getters are set to just return `True`/the setters are a no-op.
